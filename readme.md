# This is the repo used for Cory's CS 231 class, Programming Paradigms

#### This is not intended to be used for copying my code, rather as a point of access for tested solutions

I also intend to make all my solutions work in Visual Studio Code in Windows, so far that's worked. If I'm unable to, I'll make note of it in the project-folder

## Project 4 will not compile/run in windows, it utilizes linux-unique commands such as uniq and sort
